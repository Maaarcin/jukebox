GRUNGE MOVIE JUKEBOX

This is the initial part of the Grunge Jukebox project, the first original idea after my completion of the Front-End bootcamp.
The whole work will be supplemented by other elements introducing more dynamics. 

For this simple implementation, I focused on using JS to display video without using the IFrame Player API from YouTube.The official videos belonging to the YouTube partner can not be played on specific sites or apps (viewable only on YouTube), they are blocked. As a result of on this site the other versions of the songs are used as examples.

The technologies used so far are: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Git.

Grunge Movie Jukebox contains 12 selected alternative grunge rock songs from the 90s. To watch a movie just push the button with number.
